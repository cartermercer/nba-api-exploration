Using API for getting NBA stats data: https://pypi.org/project/nba-api/

A file with Python code was written in a Jupyter Notebook as a script to run and get more detailed look of the code that is being outputted in each step. 
There is also another file with Python code written in a Jupyter Notebook as a consolidated version of the script - as a function to get the current day's quarter data from a team.
An excel file is shown as an example of the output. Total runtime is only 30 seconds to get all of the end of quarter data from all of today's NBA games.
