Using API for getting NBA stats data: https://pypi.org/project/nba-api/

A file with Python code was written in a Jupyter Notebook as a function to get the current day's quarter data from a team.
An excel file is shown as an example of the output. Total runtime is only 30 seconds to get all of the end of quarter data from all of today's NBA games.
